This addon adds 3D markers of all POIs around Tamriel. It is an improved compass, more visual and easier to use.

[SIZE="3"][COLOR="YellowGreen"]Disclaimer[/COLOR][/SIZE]

This addon was created as a showcase for the [URL="https://www.esoui.com/downloads/info4108-LibImplex.html"]LibImplex[/URL] library, which handles all types of 3D markers, but then I decided to make a complete addon out of it. My goal is to add as much points as possible (default POIs like wayshrines, bosses, delves, etc., skyshards, custom POIs, e.x. books, psijic breaches).

Table of default POIs:
POIs added / POIs total on the map (number in parentheses are not important). I can't reach some places because I need to go through quests to do so, I will do it later if nobody share these before I have time for  questing.

[LIST]
[*] Contains almost all default POIs of Tamriel (wayshrines, bosses, delves, dungeons, arenas, ...)
[*] POIs visible from 5m to 235m (POIs appear on the compass near 235m, so I chose this distance)
[*] POIs change transparency based on distance
[*] POIs have a label with accurate distance
[*] You can see POI's name when looked at directly
[*] You can place waypoint near any POI and this POI will be visible for all time and will have waypoint mark on top
[*] You can use default map filters to disable particular types of POIs
[/LIST]

[SIZE="3"][COLOR="YellowGreen"]Roadmap[/COLOR][/SIZE]
[LIST]
[*] Add settings with customization (transparency, distances when markers are visible, choise which typers of markers should be visible)
[*] Add UI to more easily see which points have been added [50% - implemented but hidden]
[*] Add all POIs in Tamriel [99%, see spoiler with added locations]
[*] Add UI to move markers precisely and edit them more easily (similar to the housing interface for moving furniture)
[*] Add 3D markers for wayshrines, banks, etc.
[*] More refactoring
